This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph web-it-2004-all.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-05 07:05:12.975586

The undirected graph web-it-2004-all has 41290682 nodes, of which 34 are
singletons (all have self-loops), and 1042481474 unweighted edges, of which
15006527 are self-loops. The graph is extremely sparse as it has a density
of 0.00000 and has 67 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 41290577 nodes and the component with the least nodes has a single
node. The graph median node degree is 16, the mean node degree is 50.13,
and the node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 26424113
(degree 1326745), 26424111 (degree 1321720), 26424107 (degree 1320756),
26424108 (degree 1320753) and 26424106 (degree 1320753).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import WebIt2004All

    # Then load the graph
    graph = WebIt2004All()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
