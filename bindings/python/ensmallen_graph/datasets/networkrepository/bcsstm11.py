This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph bcsstm11.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 08:06:31.949034

The undirected graph bcsstm11 has 1473 nodes, of which 1473 are singletons
(all have self-loops), and 1473 weighted edges, of which 1473 are self-loops.
The graph is quite sparse as it has a density of 0.00068 and has 1473 connected
components, where the component with most nodes has a single node and the
component with the least nodes has a single node. The graph median node
degree is 1, the mean node degree is 1.00, and the node degree mode is
1. The top 5 most central nodes are 1473 (degree 1), 1472 (degree 1), 1471
(degree 1), 1470 (degree 1) and 1469 (degree 1).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import Bcsstm11

    # Then load the graph
    graph = Bcsstm11()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
