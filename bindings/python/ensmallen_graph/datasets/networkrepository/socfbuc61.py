This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph socfb-UC61.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 11:50:36.821744

The undirected graph socfb-UC61 has 13746 nodes and 442174 unweighted edges,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is sparse as it has a density of
0.00468 and has 6 connected components, where the component with most nodes
has 13736 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The
graph median node degree is 44, the mean node degree is 64.33, and the
node degree mode is 1. The top 5 most central nodes are 12564 (degree 687),
13290 (degree 676), 2428 (degree 626), 8991 (degree 623) and 7935 (degree
619).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import SocfbUc61

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SocfbUc61()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
