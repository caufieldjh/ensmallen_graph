This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Lachnospiraceae bacterium 284.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 20:41:58.649843

The undirected graph Lachnospiraceae bacterium 284 has 3990 nodes and 426864
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.05364 and has 15 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 3951 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 159, the mean node degree is 213.97,
and the node degree mode is 4. The top 5 most central nodes are 397287.C807_01171
(degree 1662), 397287.C807_02047 (degree 1405), 397287.C807_03723 (degree
1355), 397287.C807_03593 (degree 1272) and 397287.C807_02239 (degree 1268).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import LachnospiraceaeBacterium284

    # Then load the graph
    graph = LachnospiraceaeBacterium284()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Whether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
