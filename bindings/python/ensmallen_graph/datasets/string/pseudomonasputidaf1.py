This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Pseudomonas putida F1.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 20:33:23.000192

The undirected graph Pseudomonas putida F1 has 5221 nodes and 718912 weighted edges,
of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density of 0.05276 and
has 8 connected components, where the component with most nodes has 5200 nodes and
the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 246,
the mean node degree is 275.39, and the node degree mode is 4. The top 5 most central
nodes are 351746.Pput_0140 (degree 1887), 351746.Pput_0830 (degree 1863), 351746.Pput_4949
(degree 1493), 351746.Pput_4603 (degree 1369) and 351746.Pput_1072 (degree 1365).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import PseudomonasPutidaF1

    # Then load the graph
    graph = PseudomonasPutidaF1()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
