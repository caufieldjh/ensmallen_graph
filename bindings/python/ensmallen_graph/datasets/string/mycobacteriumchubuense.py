This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Mycobacterium chubuense.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 21:35:00.527493

The undirected graph Mycobacterium chubuense has 5147 nodes and 838228
weighted edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it
has a density of 0.06329 and has 16 connected components, where the component
with most nodes has 5105 nodes and the component with the least nodes has
2 nodes. The graph median node degree is 259, the mean node degree is 325.72,
and the node degree mode is 4. The top 5 most central nodes are 710421.Mycch_0293
(degree 2436), 710421.Mycch_3556 (degree 2156), 710421.Mycch_1631 (degree
2122), 710421.Mycch_2573 (degree 1872) and 710421.Mycch_3426 (degree 1674).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import MycobacteriumChubuense

    # Then load the graph
    graph = MycobacteriumChubuense()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Whether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
